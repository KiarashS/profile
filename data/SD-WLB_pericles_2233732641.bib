abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) is a modern approach for current computer and data networks. The increase in the number of business websites has resulted in an exponential growth in web traffic. To cope with the increased demands, multiple web servers with a front-end load balancer are widely used by organizations and businesses as a viable solution to improve the performance. In this paper, we propose a load-balancing mechanism for SDN. Our approach allocates web requests to each server according to its response time and the traffic volume of the corresponding switch port. The centralized SDN controller periodically collects this information to maintain an up-to-date view of the load distribution among the servers, and incoming user requests are redirected to the most appropriate server. The simulation results confirm the superiority of our approach compared to several other techniques. Compared to LBBSRT, round robin, and random selection methods, our mechanism improves the average response time by 19.58\%, 33.94\%, and 57.41\%, respectively. Furthermore, the average improvement of throughput in comparison with these algorithms is 16.52\%, 29.72\%, and 58.27\%, respectively.},
